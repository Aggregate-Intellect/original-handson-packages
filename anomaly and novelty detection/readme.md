## Anomaly and Novelty Detection ****


This directory contains notebooks explaining Anomaly Detection in form of exercises from different sessions. 

The topics that are similar to anomaly detection are - {Outlier, Novelty, Out-of-Distribution, Rare events} detection. 

Each session is based as follows:

- ### **Session 1**
  - This session explains various techniques to detect anomalies.
  - Folder contains a Presentation file and a Completed Jupter notebook.
  - The notebook explains how to visualize anomalies using synthetic, Credit Card Fraud and MNIST datasets.
  - The activites of notebook on a high level are as follows:
    
    - Creation and visualising of Synthetic data
    - Detecting anomaly using Gaussian model, Standard Deviation, histograms, KNN, Local Outlier Factor
    - Detecting Anomalies using the Credit card Fraud and MNIST data
    - Dataset can be accessed from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qck0qOmLKD-DJotqL2ggwKcHZRnMToxD).
