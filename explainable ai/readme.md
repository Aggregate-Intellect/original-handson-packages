# Introduction

This module contains notebooks for the two popular explanation packages - SHAP & LIME. 

These notebooks are presented as materials for [the Explainable AI Course](https://ai.science/w/xai?breakdown-by-week-tab=overview&tab=all-materials) at [AISC](https://ai.science/)

# Prerequisites

Using these notebooks requires a Python & Jupyter environment, such as Anaconda. You will need basic knowledge of the Python language and be able to run a Jupyter notebook.

# Requirements

The libraries that the notebook runs are in `requirements.txt`. These can be installed with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` if you are using `pip`. Alternatively, you can simply check the file, and install the requirements one by one.

During installation, it may be required to reboot the system. In particular, the package `aix360` challenging to install. I believe that the problems were related to the issue related to a version conflict with Tensorflow, but I am not sure. See [this pull request](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIX360/pull/109). Eventually after a few forced installs (`pip install --force aix360`) and a reboot, it worked properly.

Note: In `requirements.txt`, I set the versions of the libraries that I used to run the notebook in June 2021. Users can feel free to experiment with up-to-date versions, and upgrade accordingly by setting the requirements.txt. (Sinan Ozel)

# LIME Notebooks

These notebooks are part of [Unit 2](https://ai.science/w/xai?breakdown-by-week-tab=xai-week2&tab=all-materials) of [the Explainable AI Course](https://ai.science/w/xai?breakdown-by-week-tab=overview&tab=all-materials).


# SHAP Notebooks

These notebooks are part of [Unit 3](https://ai.science/w/xai?breakdown-by-week-tab=xai-week3&tab=all-materials) of [the Explainable AI Course](https://ai.science/w/xai?breakdown-by-week-tab=overview&tab=all-materials).
