# Machine Learning and Operations [MLOPS] 

Hello and Welcome to **[MLOps package](https://ai.science/w/mlops?all-materials-tab=week1-mlops&tab=all-materials)**. This Course package will give you the information regarding Machine Learning packaging requirement, packaging methods and technologes and Serving methods for ML models. You will get an idea about the model contarization using docker hub. We will deploy dockerize model in local environment and AWS EC2 instance.
