## What is this?
This repository contains notebooks from our premium content packages (previously only available through paid susbcription) that is now open-sourced for all developers to enjoy. For more details about us and to see all our content visit [our website](https://ai.science)

## What can I contribute?
You can contribute by:

- even better, fixing them and submitting pull requests so that all your peers can enjoy up to date and high quality content, or
- using the content to carry out projects and then add those as additional notebooks for others to use 

The majority of the notebooks run PyTorch, but there is also content in good old Python. If you don't feel ready to make a code contribution yet, no problem! You can help by adding documentaiton or openinging new issues; check out [the documentation issues](https://github.com/Aggregate-Intellect/original-handson-packages/issues).

We will add more details and resources over time to help you contribute more effectively.
