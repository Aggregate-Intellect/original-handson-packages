## Assignments
- @Percy Chen and @Mahdi there are 2 packages that use graphs, can I suggest that you collaborate on these 2 together? *GNN* and *ml in cybersecurity*
- @Mahesh Sudhakar *semi-supervised learning*
- @Leslie Arroyo and @Pablo Benavides *math of DL*
- @Deepanshu Setia and @Saim Mehmood *NLP* (there are 2 NLP packages and it might take a bit of work to combine them all into one repo)
- @Saisreenath Srinivasan Govindarajan and @Vedant Dave *MLOps* (there are 2 MLOps packages, one is more Azure focused, and one is mostly on open source - it might be helpful for you to initially assess if we need to keep these separate or put them together into one repo)

- @Kulsoom Abdullah *transformers*
- @Andrew Berry *GAN*
