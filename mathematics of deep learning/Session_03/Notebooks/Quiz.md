# Quiz 3

#### What is the resulting vector when a Sobel filter is applied on a region of constant intensity?
    * Zero vector
    * Unit vector
    * Vector with intensity values of that region


#### Using larger Sobel filters results in mode edge blurring. How can you resolve this issue?


#### The Scharr filter has a better rotational invariance than the Sobel filter
    * True
    * False
    * Data Insufficient

#### Why is Spatial Dropout used instead of Regular Dropout for Convolutional Neural Networks?


#### Can convolutional neural networks be used for structured prediction, rather than just predicting a classification label?


#### Spatial Dropout is more effective in the lower layers of the network rather than the higher layers. Why is that?


#### The ReLU activation function used in CNNs can lead to exploding gradients. How do you take care of that?


#### In what cases does it make sense to use a triplet loss function?


#### Is there an advantage of using a Global Pooling Layer over FC layers in the last layers of a CNN? What is it?


#### Depthwise seperable convolutions are a lot more computationally efficient than 2D convolutions. What is their drawback though?
