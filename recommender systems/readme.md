## Notebooks

- `1.0-movielens-eda` gives a quick introduction to recommender system and explores the Movie Lens dataset to prep for the rest of the notebooks
- `1.1-movielens-memory-based-recsys` demonstrates some examples of memory-based recommender systems using the Movie Lens dataset
- `1.2-movielens-model-based-recsys` shows two model-based recommender system approaches: Matrix Factorization and a back propagation approach
- `1.3-trivago-ranking-in-recsys` illustrates how to approach item ranking and evaluate results in recommender systems
- `2.0-node2vec` explores graph representation for recommender systems by introducing node2vec
- `2.1-pagerank-dampening` inspects the dampening effect of Google's PageRank algorithm
- `3.0-movielens-vae-for-cf` is a PyTorch-adaptive implementation of the Variational Autoencoder for Collaborative Filtering using the Movie Lens dataset
