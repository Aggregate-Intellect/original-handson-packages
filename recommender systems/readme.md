# Content

## Notebooks

- `1.0-movielens-eda` explores the Movie Lens dataset
- `1.1-movielens-memory-based-recsys` demonstrates some examples of memory-based recommender systems using the Movie Lens dataset
- `1.2-movielens-model-based-recsys` shows two model-based recommender system approaches: Matrix Factorization and a back propagation approach
- `2.0-trivago-ranking-in-recsys` illustrates how to approach item ranking in recommender systems
- `2.1-pagerank-dampening` inspects the dampening effect of Google's PageRank algorithm
- `2.2-trivago-node2vec` explores graphs for recommender systems and introduction to node2vec
- `3.0-movielens-vae-for-cf` a PyTorch-adaptive implementation of the Variational Autoencoder for Collaborative Filtering using the Movie Lens dataset

## Data

The data folder stores the two datasets used in the notebooks: Movie Lens (ml-20m) and Trivago.
