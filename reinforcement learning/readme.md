This directory contains the code associated with the Reinforcement Learning Workshop. It is been organized into three sessions and their respective Jupyter notebooks. The contents in each notebooks are as follows.

- Session 1
	- Epsilon-greedy algorithm
	- Value Iteration Algorithm
	- Off-policy Monte Carlo
	- Qlearning
	- SARSA
	- On-policy First Visit Monte Carlo

- Session 2
	- Deep Q-learning
	- Double Deep Q-learning
	- Duelling Deep Q-learning	
	- Noisy Nets
    - N look ahead Buffer
    - Prioritized Experience Replay
    
- Session 3
	- Vanilla Policy Gradient
	- Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients
	- Build your own environment
