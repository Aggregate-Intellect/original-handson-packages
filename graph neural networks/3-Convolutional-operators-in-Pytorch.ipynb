    "\n",
    "PyG has a lot of useful convolution-like operators already implemented. Moreover, with the  `MessagePassing` Base Class of PyG, it is easy to implement additional operators. In this notebook we will implement the graph convolutional operator from the paper [Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907) (Kipf and Welling ICLR 2017). In the process we will be translating equations from the paper into code."
