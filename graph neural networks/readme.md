# Graph Neural Networks
This Course package will introduce GNNs. The package contains the following 9 notebooks and you should follow them in that order:

Suggested timeline

- Week 1 (unit 1)
  - AISC_GNNs_1_Introduction_v2.ipynb
  - AISC_GNNs_Introduction_bonus_point_clouds.ipynb (optional)
  - 2_node_classification_SGC.ipynb
  - 2_node_classification_GAT.ipynb

- Week 2 (unit 2)
  - 3-Convolutional-operators-in-Pytorch.ipynb
  - 4_node_embedding_based_link_prediction.ipynb

- Week 3 (unit 3)
  - 5_link_prediction_as_graph_prediction.ipynb (optional)
  - 6_heterogeneous_networks.ipynb

For those who want to do a project using what they learn in these notebooks, we suggest the following timeline:

- week 1: intros / ice breaker - q&a about the logistics - q&a about potential projects (**to-do:** find teammates based on the project on [slack channel](http://aisc-to.slack.com/), and work together to find a dataset for your project) 
- week 2: q&a about unit 1 notebooks - q&a about project ideas - initial team formation - q&a re: initial ideas about datasets to use
- week 3: q&a about unit 2 notebooks - finalized teams and projects / exploratory data analysis
- week 4: q&a about unit 3 notebooks - first presentation of project progress
- week 5: second presentation of project progress

Projects should aim to have at least a base model trained by week 5. However, if the teams are interested, they can continue working on the projects for another 5 weeks during the next cohort. 

Note that, we might invite you to contribute your notebooks to the repository if your results are particularly interesting.
